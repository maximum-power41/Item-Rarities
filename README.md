# Item-Rarities
Minecraft Versions: 1.18.1
An API for the Fabric mod loader (Minecraft) that gives items a rarity tier.

This API is meant to be used in other Fabric mods to add functionality and make them work together. On it's own it doesn't do much.
The following goals for the project are as follows:
  - Make all items have a rarity tier. 
  - Custom tooltips on items to show their rarity tier.
  - Ability to configure what items have rarity tiers, how they are obtained, rarity tier generation chances, etc.
  - (Under Review) Make items show the color of their rarity tier around the item when in an item slot.
  - Ability to add new rarity tiers.
  - Add hooks to allow mods to do things when certain actions are performed like when generating a rarity tier.

This mod is currently a work in progress and is not ready for use. I'm a computer science student and this is my first minecrtaft mod so there might be problems/bugs. I'm working on this project to learn and for experience, but also to add mods to minecraft which I would want and haven't seen yet.
